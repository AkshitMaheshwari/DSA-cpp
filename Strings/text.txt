Davision and grammer experiment:

(1) Davisionand grammer gave first experimental evidence of matter wave predicted by 
de-brogile

(2) This experiment not inly confirmed the existence of waves associated with fast moving 
electrons but also measured the wavelength of matter wave 

(3) The experimental setup consist of an electron gun having tungsten filanment which is 
heated by passing electric current from low tension battery

(4) Due to thermionic emissions electrons are emitted by filanment and these electrons are
emitted by the filanment and these electrons are then accelerated under suitable potential
difference provided by high tension battery

(5) The narrow beam of electrons comes out form cylinder is allowed to fall on the surface 
of a nickel crystal 

(6) The electrons, scattered in different directions by the atoms of nickel crystal are 
required by a movable detector which is just an electron collector 

(7) The electron collection is converted with an galvanometer 

(8) The deflection (G) is directly proportional to the intensity of electric beam entering
the collector 

(9) The entire apparatus is enclosed in vacumm chamber
